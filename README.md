# evaluation-method-and-random-forest <br />
all about evaluation method and random forest <br />
1)k-fold cross validation (here k is user-define) (we model is over or underfitting) <br />
-Steps involved in k-fold cross validation <br />
2)3)bootstrap method(we used mainly for decision tree)(when you have high variance) <br />
-But why bootstrap method came <br />
-Why only  bootstrap method ? <br />
-Steps involved in bootstrap <br />
-sampling with replacement <br />
3)Random forest <br />
-But why random forest ? <br />
-So how random forest works ? <br />
-random forest but now how to used it <br />
-out of Bag dataset  <br />
-Random forest consider 2 types of missing data <br />
-How to calculate the distance plot out 0f proximity matrix <br />
-how to calculate the proximity value to distance of closet similar value <br />
